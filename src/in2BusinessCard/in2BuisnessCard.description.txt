###Description:

[`in2BuisnessCard`](https://github.com/Tweety-FER/in2ngPlayground/blob/master/src/in2BusinessCard/in2BusinessCard.directive.js) is a directive that implements a virtual buisness card. It represents a real buisness card and has two sides. The front side has company's logo, company's name, and employee's name and position. The back side has larger version of logo and motivational message. Those variables are binded to the directive's scope in the following way:
	- `company`, `fullName`, `position` and `image` using simple binding
	- `frontSide` using two-way binding; it represents the side the card is first turned on, default: true

The directive is binded to the controller [`in2BusinessCardController`](https://github.com/Tweety-FER/in2ngPlayground/blob/master/src/in2BusinessCard/in2BusinessCard.controller.js).
The card's appearance and behaviour is defined with html file - [`in2BuisnessCard.html`](https://github.com/Tweety-FER/in2ngPlayground/blob/master/src/in2BusinessCard/in2BuisnessCard.template.html).
The card can be flipped by clicking on it, which is defined with `ng-click` directive inside html template. It takes `frontSide` attribute from controller and changes it's value on every click. That values are then used in `ng-switch` directive which selects front or back side of the card, depending on the switched attribute value.

The directive is used by using it's name as a html element in the following way:

'''html
<in2-business-card company="IN2" full-name="Ivan Rep" position="Senior Minion", image="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/557113121748160513/opy8TCJe.png"></in2-business-card>
'''

Upon loading the webpage, `<in2-business-card>` is replaced with the [`in2BuisnessCard.html`](https://github.com/Tweety-FER/in2ngPlayground/blob/master/src/in2BusinessCard/in2BuisnessCard.template.html) defined in the template as a new element.
