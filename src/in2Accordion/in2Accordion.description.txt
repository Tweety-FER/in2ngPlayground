###Description:

[`in2Accordion`](https://github.com/Tweety-FER/in2ngPlayground/blob/master/src/in2Accordion/in2Accordion.directive.js) is a transcluded directive which also contains nested child transcluded directives called [`in2AccordionItem`](https://github.com/Tweety-FER/in2ngPlayground/blob/master/src/in2Accordion/in2AccordionItem.directive.js).
It can be used in the following way:
	```html
	<in2-accordion>
	  <in2-accordion-item title="What are directives?">
		I have no idea
	  </in2-accordion-item>
	  <in2-accordion-item title="Why use them?">
		That's what I was told to do
	  </in2-accordion-item>
	  <in2-accordion-item title="How do I write one?">
		Just mash on the keyboard until something happens
	  </in2-accordion-item>
	</in2-accordion>
	```
It uses controller [`in2AccordionController`](https://github.com/Tweety-FER/in2ngPlayground/blob/master/src/in2Accordion/in2Accordion.controller.js) to store and return transcluded accorion item elements. It gets it's appearance from template [`in2Accordion.template.html`](https://github.com/Tweety-FER/in2ngPlayground/blob/master/src/in2Accordion/in2Accordion.template.html).

Accordion items are defined by [`in2AccordionItem`](https://github.com/Tweety-FER/in2ngPlayground/blob/master/src/in2Accordion/in2AccordionItem.directive.js) directive, which has requirement for in2Accordion parent element. It is also a transcluded directive which contains it's text as a transcluded element. It is linked to parent's controller so it could have access to array of all items. This is required so it's controller can open selected item, while closing all others at the same time. All items are initially closed, and clicking on one of them opens it, while closing all others in the process. On first click on any item, its controller initializes its `accordionItems` array with data from all the items. This enables opening and closing of any array from any item's instance of [`in2AccordionItemController`](https://github.com/Tweety-FER/in2ngPlayground/blob/master/src/in2Accordion/in2AccordionItem.controller.js).
