Accordion items are defined by in2AccordionItem directive, which has requirement for in2Accordion parent element.
It is also a transcluded directive which contains it's text as a transcluded element.
It is linked to parent's controller so it could have access to array of all items.
This is required so it's controller can open selected item, while closing all others at the same time.
All items are initially closed, and clicking on one of them opens it, while closing all others in the process.

This enables opening and closing of any array from any item's instance of in2AccordionItemController.
